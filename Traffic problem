Traffic problem blog.
----------------------
Everyday when I go to office from Electronic city to Bellandur, I find more traffic unless there is long weekend near by or some public holiday 
or strike ( which by the way happend bery frequently in Bangalore :). 
Since I drive for more than an hour, I use this time to think about nothing but this problem. To capture my thoughts and share with people
I am starting this series about traffic congestion. and this is the first one. Let's say how long I can write and if it leads to somewhere. 

First thing which comes to my mind is " Rise and Rise of Ola and Uber". 
First let me be very clear. I am big fan of Ola. They really revolutionised the taxi market in India. OLA is like Meru 2.0 .
Meru pioneered the web technology enabled booking system. OLA did the same with mobile technology. in the mean time Uber came along first
as premium service provider but later joined Ola in competition. 
What I (mean aam aadmi) that it is easy to book, easy to track and easy to pay. All keeping the cost not only affordable but making it cheaper
(atleast till they get funding). 
Problem. While this sounds really fantastic and looks like convenience, effectively it is not if we look at the big picture. 
What is the big picture?
