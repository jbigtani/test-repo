Traffic problem blog.
----------------------
Everyday when I go to office from Electronic city to Bellandur, I find more traffic unless there is long weekend near by or some public holiday 
or strike ( which by the way happend bery frequently in Bangalore :). 
Since I drive for more than an hour, I use this time to think about nothing but this problem. To capture my thoughts and share with people
I am starting this series about traffic congestion. and this is the first one. Let's say how long I can write and if it leads to somewhere. 

First thing which comes to my mind is " Rise and Rise of Ola and Uber".
